      read(line, '(i4,3i4,i4)') a, arr, b

        A string or integer in a field width of ``N``. For example 'i5, s20'.
    MiN
        An array of ``M`` intgers, each in an ``N`` character field.
        The returned value is a list of integers.

    Note: This is throw-away code, which does not error checking.
