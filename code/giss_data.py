"""Classes for GISTEMP data.

Primarily, the classes herein support monthly temperature series.
Typically these are either for stations (station records) or subboxes
(subbox series).  In either case the same class is used, `Series`,
differing in what keyword arguments are supplied.

station records
    Stores a set of monthly averages associated with a particular monitoring
    `Station`.

subbox series
    Stores monthly averages for a subbox, typically synthesized by
    combining several station records together.

Both types of record can be grouped in collections, often (in the original
GISTEMP code) in files. Collections of records have associated metadata,
the `StationMetaData` and `SubboxMetaData` classes.

# TODO: Needs some review. Among things to think about:

# 3. Some of the names are open to improvement.
class Series(object):
    """Monthly temperature Series.

    An instance contains a series of monthly data (in ccc-gistemp
    the data are average monthly temperature values in degrees
    Celsius), accessible via the `series` property.  This property
    should **always** be treated as read-only; the effect of modifying
    elements is undefined.

    The series coveres the months from `first_month` to `last_month` month
    inclusive. Months are counted from a non-existant year zero. So January,
    1 AD has a month number of 13, February is 14, etc.

    The GISTEMP/CCC code only uses data that starts from `BASE_YEAR` (1880).
    Some code works on data series that start from this base year. So it is
    convenient to be able to work in terms of years and months relative to this
    base year. There are a number of properties with names that start with
    `rel_` that provide values using this alternative reference.

    Note that most of the series metadata is provided by properties, which
    are effectively read-only. All the instance variables should also be
    treated as read-only and you should only set values in the data series
    using the provided methods.

    There are no subclasses of this class.  Some instances represent
    station records, other instances represent subbox series.

    For station records there can be multiple series for a single `Station`.
    The `station` property provides the associated `Station` instance.
    For a given station the different series are called "duplicates" in
    GHCN terminology; they have a 12-digit uid that is made up of an
    11-digit station identifier and a single extra digit to distinguish
    each of the station's series.

    Generally a station record will have its uid supplied as a keyword
    argument to the constructor (accessing the `station` property relies
    on this):

    :Ivar uid:
        An integer that acts as a unique ID for the time series. This
        is generally a 12-digit identifier taken from the GHCN file; the
        first 11 digits comprise an identifier for the station.
	The last digit distinguishes this series from other series
	from the same station.

    A first year can be supplied to the constructor which will base the
    series at that year:

    :Ivar first_year:
        Set the first year of the series.  Data that are
        subsequently added using add_year will be ignored if they
        precede first_year (a typical use is to set first_year to 1880
        for all records, ensuring that they all start at the same year).

    When used to hold a series for a subbox, for example a record of data
    as stored in the ``input/SBBX.HadR2`` file, then the following
    keyword arguments are traditionally supplied to the constructor:

    :Ivar lat_S, lat_N, lon_W, lon_E:
        Coordinates describing the box's area.
    :Ivar stations:
        The number of stations that contributed to this sub-box.
    :Ivar station_months:
        The number of months that contributed to this sub-box.
    :Ivar d:
        Characteristic distance to station closest to centre.
