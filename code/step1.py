"""
Python code reproducing the STEP1 part of the GISTEMP algorithm.

Requires the following files in the input/ directory,
from GISTEMP STEP1/input_files/:

mcdw.tbl
ushcn2.tbl
sumofday.tbl
v2.inv

Do not be tempted to replace v2.inv with the apparently similar
v2.temperature.inv file available from NOAA,
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v2/v2.temperature.inv .  The
NOAA file has been treated for GISTEMP's use by, for example, adding
records corresponding to Antarctic stations that are not used in GHCN
but are used in the GISTEMP analysis.  Step 1 (this step) expects to
find a record in v2.inv for every station it has a time series for.

Requires the following files in the config/ directory,
from GISTEMP STEP1/input_files/:

combine_pieces_helena.in
Ts.strange.RSU.list.IN
Ts.discont.RS.alter.IN

Also requires the existence of writeable work/ and log/ directories.

# temperatures: data[m][y], where m ranges from 0 to 11 and y from 0

# This "2D array" is actually a list of array.array values. For
# instance, data[2] is an array of all the values for March.

# 'id'      : the station ID
# 'begin'   : first year of data

# v2.mean_comb file and metadata files) by the from_lines() and
# read_v2() functions.
#
# The rotation between year-major data (in the inputs and outputs
# of this step) and month-major data (everywhere inside this step) is
