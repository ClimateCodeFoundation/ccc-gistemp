"""
Python code reproducing the STEP1 part of the GISTEMP algorithm.

Requires the following files in the input/ directory,
from GISTEMP STEP1/input_files/:

mcdw.tbl
ushcn2.tbl
sumofday.tbl
v2.inv

Do not be tempted to replace v2.inv with the apparently similar
v2.temperature.inv file available from NOAA,
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v2/v2.temperature.inv .  The
NOAA file has been treated for GISTEMP's use by, for example, adding
records corresponding to Antarctic stations that are not used in GHCN
but are used in the GISTEMP analysis.  Step 1 (this step) expects to
find a record in v2.inv for every station it has a time series for.

Requires the following files in the config/ directory,
from GISTEMP STEP1/input_files/:

combine_pieces_helena.in
Ts.strange.RSU.list.IN
Ts.discont.RS.alter.IN

Also requires the existence of writeable work/ and log/ directories.

# From stationstring.py
#
# A StationString encapsulates a dict and a set of temperature records
# for a single station.  The set of temperature records is a 2D array
# of floating-point temperatures: data[m][y], where m ranges from 0 to
# 11 and y from 0 to N.  Missing values are recorded as 999.9.
#
# This "2D array" is actually a list of array.array values. For
# instance, data[2] is an array of all the values for March.
#
# The dict has various fields, including the following:
# 'id'      : the station ID
# 'begin'   : first year of data
# 'name'
# 'lat'     : (floating-point) latitude
# 'lon'     : (floating-point) longitude
# 'elevs'
# 'elevg'
# 'pop'
# 'ipop'
# 'topo'
# 'stveg',
# 'stloc'
# 'iloc'
# 'airstn'
# 'itowndis'
# 'grveg'
# 
# The BDB files contain StationStrings as serialized by the
# serialize() function.  When manipulating data for a station from a
# BDB file, it is converted to a StationString using the __init__()
# method.
# 
# The data and dict items are originally created (from the
# v2.mean_comb file and metadata files) by the from_lines() and
# v2_fill_dbm() functions.
#
# The rotation between year-major data (in the inputs and outputs
# of this step) and month-major data (everywhere inside this step) is
# done by from_lines() and write_to_file().

# Notes:
#
# The records in each BDB are as follows:
# 
# IDS -> space-separated list of station IDs
# BAD -> '9999'
# id  -> station data (format defined by stationstring.serialize)
# 
# 1. v2_to_bdb() creates v2.mean_comb.bdb containing the same data as v2.mean_comb.
#
# 2. comb_records() creates v2.mean_comb.combined.bdb and comb.log
#
# 3. comb_pieces() returns a generator and makes piece.log
#
# 4. drop_strange() is a filter
#
# 5. alter_discont() is a filter
#
# 6. write_to_file() writes the results to work/Ts.txt
