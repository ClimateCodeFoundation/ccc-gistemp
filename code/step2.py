"""Python replacement for code/STEP2/*

This step performs a trend adjustment to those stations identified as
urban.  An urban station must meet various criteria to have its trend
adjusted (there must be sufficient nearby rural stations and their
combined record must have enough overlap with the urban station); if an
urban station does not meet the criteria, it is discarded.

Additionally in this step, all stations with short records are discarded
(prior to any other processing).

    """Takes an iterator of station records and applies an adjustment
    to urban stations to compensate for urban temperature effects.
    Returns an iterator of station records.  Rural stations are passed
    unchanged.  Urban stations which cannot be adjusted are discarded.

    The adjustment follows a linear or two-part linear fit to the
    difference in annual anomalies between the urban station and the
    combined set of nearby rural stations.  The linear fit is to allow
    for a linear effect at the urban station.  The two-part linear fit
    is to allow for a model of urban effect which starts or stops at
    some point during the time series.

    The algorithm is essentially as follows:

    For each urban station:
        1. Find all the rural stations within a fixed radius;
        2. Combine the annual anomaly series for those rural stations, in
           order of valid-data count;
        3. Calculate a two-part linear fit for the difference between
           the urban annual anomalies and this combined rural annual anomaly;
        4. If this fit is satisfactory, apply it; otherwise apply a linear fit.

        If there are not enough nearby rural stations, or the combined
        rural record does not have enough overlap with the urban
        record, try a second time for this urban station, with a
        larger radius.  If there is still not enough data, discard the
        urban station.
