""" 
Python code reproducing the STEP3 part of the GISTEMP algorithm.

python code/step3.py [-a N] [-s X,Y,Z]

-a N
  Restrict to subbox N and producing audit information

-s X,Y,Z
  Restrict to the list of subboxes

Work in progress.

The code is derived from the Fortran GISTEMP code.

Python notes:

Much of the binary IO uses the struct module.  A quick review will
help.

I feel obliged to tell you that the Python expression N * list gives a
new list that conists of list repeated N times.  This is used every
now and then.

We also make use of list slice assignment: a[2:4] = range(2)

    A station is returned if the great circle arc between it and the point
    of interest is less than arc radians (using angles is slightly
    odd, but makes it independent of sphere size).

    A pair (2-tuple) (t,station) is returned where t is the
    weight assigned to the station based on its distance from
    the point.  0 <= t <= 1.  The GISTEMP algorithm is used: t
    is documented as 1-(d/arc) where d is the angle, in radians,
    made by the arc between the station and the point of interest,
    but in fact d is approximated by the chord length.

    This is essentially a filter; the stations that are returned are in
    the same order in which they appear in iterable.

    pairs (for example obtained from
    list(incircle(stations.all(), 0.19, 51.5, 0))) can be sorted by
