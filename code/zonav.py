"""
Perform Zonal Averaging.

(this is typically part of STEP 5)

The input is a box file, usually work/BX.Ts.GHCN.CL.PA.1200 .  The data
in the boxes are combined to produce averages over various latitudinal
zones.  The output is a zone file,
usually work/ZON.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.1200.step1 (the output can be
converted to text with code/zontotext.py).

14 belts are produced.  The first 8 are the basic belts that are used
for the equal area grid, the remaining 6 are combinations:

(The Fortran uses 1 to 14, but here in Python we use 0 to 13)

  0 64N - 90N               \
  1 44N - 64N (asin 0.9)    |-  8 24N - 90 N  (0 + 1 + 2)
  2 24N - 44N (asin 0.7)    /
