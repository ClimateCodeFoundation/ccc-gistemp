# A pair of manually-configured adjustments to specific station
# records in GISTEMP STEP 1.  In GISTEMP, these adjustments were made
# in two distinct phases: (one configured by a file called
# Ts.discont.RS.alter.IN and the other by combine_pieces_helena.in).
# In ccc-gistemp, we combined the two into a single manual adjustment
# phase.
#
# GISTEMP itself no longer makes these adjustments (since the change
# to using the homogenized GHCN-M 3 source data).  ccc-gistemp may
# retain the ability to do them.  See extension/step1.py.
