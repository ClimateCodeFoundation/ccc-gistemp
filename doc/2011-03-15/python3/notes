ccc-gistemp Python 3 Case Study

INTRODUCTION

Notes for presenting a case study of the conversion of ccc-gistemp to
Python 3.  The initial presentation is intended to be made to the Python
NorthWest group on 2011-03-17.

== Python 3 ==

New version of the language, many deliberately incompatible changes.  To
ease the transition, use 2to3.  How does ccc-gistemp plan to
simultaneously support Python 2 and Python 3?  Primarily develop in
Python 2, but make sure that the code works when run through 2to3.  This
requires some changes now because the current result of 2to3 doesn't
work, and will require some small changes to ongoing practice.  At some
point, we'll run 2to3 and use that as our ongoing code base, dropping
Python 2.  We currently support Python versions 2.4 through to 2.7.
We support 4 versions, so numerically that suggests we'll drop Python 2
support when Python 3.3 is released and we'll switch to supporting
Python versions 3.0 to 3.3.  There has been one release of Python 3 in
each of the last 3 years.  Perhaps we'll see Python 3.3 in 2012, and
we'll be dropping Python 2 support.  Frankly it seems a bit early.

== Clarity ==

Code that is clear in Python 2 isn't necessarily clear once it's been
through 2to3.  Conversely some code that is clear after it's been
through 2to3 sometimes doesn't look clear (before 2to3).  During the
transition period, changes may emphasise the clarity of the 2to3
translated code, rather than the actual submitted code.

== An amusing bug? ==

Old code:

      lat = i[0]*math.pi/180
      z = math.sin(lat)
      c = math.cos(lat)
      long = i[1]*math.pi/180
      x = math.cos(long) * c
      y = math.sin(long) * c
      return (x,y,z)

New code (after 2to3):

      lat = i[0]*math.pi/180
      z = math.sin(lat)
      c = math.cos(lat)
      long = i[1]*math.pi/180
      x = math.cos(int) * c
      y = math.sin(int) * c
      return (x,y,z)

This code that convert a latitude,longitude coordinate to a 3D cartesian
x,y,z coordinate.  The variable names are "lat" for latitude and "long"
for longitude.

Note the change from "long" to "int".  But in this case, "long" is a
variable name, so it's inappropriate to change it.  The change 2to3 made
makes the code buggy.  As it happens the code is not usually used.  I
don't think it occurred to me when I first wrote the code that "long"
is a Python builtin.  Moral: don't name your variables after Python
builtins!

There's a similar problem in the function "sigma()" where the argument
is unwisely called "list".

== Code improvement ==

Old code:

       if helena_ds.has_key(id):

New code:

       if id in helena_ds:


== Code worse ==

Old code:

   for i,(sum,count) in enumerate(zip(sums, counts)):

New code:

   for i,(sum,count) in enumerate(list(zip(sums, counts))):

zip in Python 2 returns a list, in Python 3 it returns an iterator (like
itertools.izip).  So calls to "zip()" are wrapped in "list()".  In this
case, because enumerate works on iterators as well as lists, the call to
"list()" is not necessary, but 2to3 doesn't spot that.

== Not caught by 2to3 ==

Old code:

   for y in range(len(series)/12):

Note that in Python 2 the result of "len(series)/12" is an int.  In
Python 3 the result is a float, even when the exact answer is an integer
(as it is in this case, len(series) is always a multiple of 12).

Best fix:

   for y in range(len(series)//12):
