DOCUMENTATION

Document for ccc-gistemp.  There is not much to see yet:

lab/            lab notes written by developers as they were working on
                the code.  Unorganised, not likely to be of general interest.

input.txt       What ccc-gistemp expects to find in its input directory,
                and how to get it there.

overview.txt    A general overview of the main processing steps of the
                GISTEMP algorithm (and hence the ccc-gistemp algorithm).
                The correspondence with the published literature is
                documented.
