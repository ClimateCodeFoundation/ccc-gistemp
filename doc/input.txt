INPUT FILES

In the directory input/ ccc-gistemp expects to find its various input
data.  If any of these data are not present a tool, tool/preflight.py,
will attempt to download them from the internet.  Instead, the data can
be downloaded by hand and placed in input/.

input/
  The "big" files...

  SBBX.HadR2    - Sea surface temperatures from
      ftp://data.giss.nasa.gov/pub/gistemp/SBBX.HadR2
  ushcnv2.gz    - Temperature data from USHCN.  The location of this file
      varies (usually every month, as a new release is made).  Open
      ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2/monthly and choose the
      most recent file with the name 9641C_YYYYMM_F52.avg.gz (YYYY and
      MM are numbers for year and month).  Rename it ushcnv2.gz.
  v2.mean       - Uncompressed version of v2.mean.zip; normally created
      by ccc-gistemp automatically, download v2.mean.zip instead.
  v2.mean.zip   - Temperature data from GHCN.  Download from
      ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v2/zipd/v2.mean.zip

  And the "little" files:

  antarc1.list
  antarc1.txt
  antarc2.list
  antarc2.txt
  antarc3.list
  antarc3.txt
  mcdw.tbl
  oisstv2_mod4.clim.gz
  sumofday.tbl
  t_hohenpeissenberg_200306.txt_as_received_July17_2003
  ushcn2.tbl
  ushcnV2_cmb.tbl
  v2.inv

  The "little" files all come from
  http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/sources/GISTEMP_sources.tar.gz .
  If you are downloading by hand then you will need to download that
  file and unpack it.  The required input files are found in several
  directories:

    GISTEMP_sources/STEP0/input_files
    GISTEMP_sources/STEP1/input_files
    GISTEMP_sources/STEP4_5/input_files

  It is okay, but messy, to copy the entire contents of these
  subdirectories into input/.

  There is one optional file:

  step5mask

  If present this file is used in Step 5 to select which cells use land
  data.  Its format is novel to ccc-gistemp and is in the same format as
  the file work/step5mask that is produced by Step 5.

  Experimental GHCN v3 Facility

  (GHCN v3 is a beta product, see http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcnm/)
  If a GHCN v3 monthly temperature data file is unpacked in the
  input directory, then ccc-gistemp should find it and use it when
  'v3' is specified as a data source (see 'data_sources' in
  code/parameters.py').  Specifically, if there are any directories
  in "input/" that begin with "ghcnm" then the one whose last 8
  digits (ISO 8601 date) are last will be used.
