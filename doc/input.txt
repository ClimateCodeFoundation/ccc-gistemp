INPUT FILES

In the directory input/ ccc-gistemp expects to find its various input
data.  If any of these data are not present a tool, tool/fetch.py,
will attempt to download them from the internet.  Instead, the data
can be downloaded by hand and placed in input/.

See the file config/sources for more information about input files.
