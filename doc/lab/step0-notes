What US GHCN records remain after Step 0?

(assume only_USHCN is false; it's a new flag introduced in 2010)
- lines following "cont_US=.false."
  all non-US GHCN stations are written.  As are US stations whose ID
  precedes the first USHCN (converted) ID.

  copy GHCN until GHCN ID >= USHCN ID
  if GHCN ID > USHCN ID:
      copy USHCN until either USHCN ID > GHCN ID (goto beginning) or IDs
      are same and all USHCN years up to GHCN year have been copied

  when GHCN ID and USHCN ID match, GHCN data is discarded unless there
  is a matching USHCN year; USHCN data is copied when there is no
  matching GHCN data.  when a year has both GHCN and USHCN, the adjusted
  USHCN data is written.

so, for a station in USHCN (meaning, has records in the USHCN stream),
all the corresponding GHCN data is eliminated.

So what GHCN station data is in the GHCN stream?  All the GHCN records.

Thus (contiguous) US GHCN stations for which there are no corresponding
USHCN records are retained.
