Overview of ccc-gistemp

[todo: add more introductory notes here.  Along the lines of
"ccc-gistemp is a replication of GISTEMP, a reconstruction of global
historical temperature anomalies..."]


The GISTEMP algorithm (and hence ccc-gistemp) is organised as a series
of steps.  Data flows through the steps in a pipeline.  Early steps
deal with station records, later steps grid the data before final
large area averages are computed.  The steps are:

Step 0: Assimilates input data from various sources (usually GHCN,
USHCN, SCAR READER, and a single priv. comm. record for
Hohenpeissenberg).  Each USHCN record is adjusted so that its recent
seasonal cycle matches the recent seasonal cycle for the corresponding
GHCN record.  GHCN data for Hohenpeissenberg is replaced with priv.
comm. data.  As far as I know this is not documented in the
literature.

Step 1: A feature of GHCN (a major data source) is that a single
station can have multiple overlapping records (from different original
sources).  These are reconciled where possible, by offsetting
overlapping records by their average difference, and combining them
into one record.

Step 2: Urban Adjustment.  (short records are discarded). Stations
identified as urban (usually using values obtained from satellite
measurements of nighttime brightness) have their trend adjusted to
match the trend of a composite record made from nearby rural stations.
At least 2/3 of the adjusted period must have 3 rural stations
contributing to the composite record.  Periods and stations that do
not have sufficient support from rural stations are dropped.  The
composite rural record is made from rural stations with 500 km, or
1000 km if necessary to meet the sufficient stations requirement.
This step is documented in Hansen et al 1999, and Hansen et al 2001.

Step 3: Gridding.  A grid of cells is selected (8000 equal area cells
covering the globe, see note below), and for each cell a composite
series is computed from station records within 1200 km of the cell
centre.  Each contributing record is weighted according to its
distance from the cell centre, linearly decreasing to 0 at a distance
of 1200 km.  This step is documented in Hansen and Lebedeff 1987
(probably the key GISTEMP paper).

Step 4: Sea Surface Temperatures.  Gridded sea surface temperatures
are read from a file prepared by GISS and possible revised with recent
monthly updates.

Step 5: Ocean merging.  Ocean (Sea Surface Temperatures) and Land
(Near Surface Air Temperatures) are "merged".  A cell that has both
ocean and land records selects either the ocean or the land record:
the land record is discarded unless the ocean record is short or
the land record has a contributing land station within 100 km (in
which case the ocean record is discarded).  This part is documented
in Hansen et al 1996.

Zonal Averages.  Each hemisphere is divided into 4 zones by splitting
at the latitudes that have sines of 0.4, 0.7, 0.9 (and 0 and 1);
the latitudes of the zone boundaries are approximately 23.6, 44.4,
and 64.2 degrees.  For each zone all the cells in that zone are
combined into a single record.  Large regional averages (hemispheres,
tropics, northern- and southern-extratropics) are computed by
combining zones in various combinations, each zone weighted according
to the zone's area.  Zonal averaging is documented in Hansen and
Lebedeff 1987 and Hansen and Lebedeff 2006 (each of which describes
an alternate scheme, the latter is what is currently implemented,
but relictual code exists for the former).

Global Average.  A global series is computed by combining
northern- and southern-hemisphere series, weighted equally.

Annual series are computed from their monthly counterparts.

Step 6: various visualisations are produced (only some of which we do).


A note on gridding

The grid used (in step 3 and subsequently) divides the globe into
8000 equal area cells.  It is based on the zonal scheme outlined
in Step 5 above.  There are 4 zones per hemisphere, and the choice
of sines means that the zones have areas in the ratio 4:3:2:1.  Each
zone is divided by longitude into a number of boxes proportional to the
area of the zone: 16, 12, 8, 4.  Thus there are 80 boxes, all having the
same area.  Each box is divided into 100 (10 by 10) cells each having equal
area.
