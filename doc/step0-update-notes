Notes on STEP0 changes in GISTEMP between 2008-09-11 and 2009-12-03.
Nick Barnes, Ravenbrook Limited, 2009-12-17

Summary:

- reads USHCNv2 data if present.

- A "skip_US" parameter, which defaults to zero and which I propose
  not to implement at present.

- has updated Antarctica data and station tables.

Plan:

- import updated Antarctica data and station tables. [DONE]

- import ushcnV2_cmb.tbl [DONE]

- Change preflight to get USHCN v2 file 9641C_200907_F52.avg [DONE]

- Change step0.py to use USHCN v2 file. [DONE]

- Disregard skip_US parameter. [DONE]

do_comb_step0.sh:
  New command-line arguments:
  if $2 is 7, "skip austr.source"
  if $3 is non-zero, skip GHCN data for [some of] the US, and just use USHCN data.

  There has been a small amount of rearrangement of the shell script.

  The get_USHCN script has changed a lot (see below).

  There is manipulation of the file input_files/Ts.strange.RSU.list.IN_full
  to produce the file temp_files/Ts.strange.RSU.list.IN
  which is later used in STEP1.  This is partly in the get_USHCN
  scripts, but note that if skip_US is zero (default behaviour) then
  we get the original file (which has the same contents as in the
  previous version of GISTEMP).

  What's going on there is that this file identifies station records
  or partial records in GHCN which should be skipped.  If the skip_US
  switch is on, the GHCN records relating to the US are omitted and
  should be dropped from this file.

  antarc_to_v2.sh is passed $2 as an argument, although it appears not
  to use it.

  cmb2.ushcn.v2.exe is passed the skip_US parameter as first argument

Looking in order through the various other source files used:

antarc_to_v2.sh is identical

antarc1.txt, antarc2.txt, antarc3.txt, antarc3.list all differ: new data, updated data, corrected station metadata

There is a small difference in antarc_comb.f, fixing a potential bug
which doesn't actually occur in practice (one line of data would be
discarded if Antarctic data comes later than all v2.mean data).

dump_old.f is identical

ushcn.tbl is now called ushcn1.tbl (identical contents).

get_USHCN:
  If hcn_doe_mean_data is missing, or 9641C_200907_F52.avg is present,
  run get_USHCN_v2 instead (see below)

  Otherwise, we're still using USHCNv1 data:
    USHCN2v2.f has been renamed USHCN_to_v2.f
    move ushcn1.tbl to ushcn.tbl
    move the IN_full file to IN

get_USHCN_v2 is all new.  It runs unify_us_ids to translate new
station IDs in the USHCNv2 data to old station IDs.  Then it runs
USHCNv2_to_v2.f.  Finally it runs the reduce_strange.sh script to
remove USHCNv2 stations from the Ts.strange file:
    #!/bin/ksh

    fortran_compile=${FC}

    echo "replacing USHCN station data in $1 by USHCN_V2 data (all adjustments, but ignoring fill-ins)"
    cd input_files
    echo "unifying station-ids"
    ./unify_us_ids 9641C_200907_F52.avg
    cd ..

    mkdir temp_files 2> /dev/null
    sort -n input_files/ushcn2.tbl > ID_US_G
    ${fortran_compile} USHCNv2_to_v2.f -o USHCNv2_to_v2.exe
    USHCNv2_to_v2.exe  ; rm -f USHCNv2_to_v2.exe
    sort -n USHCN.v2.mean_noFIL > USHCN.v2.mean_noFIL.sort
    mv -f USHCN.v2.mean_noFIL.sort USHCN.v2.mean_noFIL

    cd input_files
    reduce_strange.sh
    mv Ts.strange.RSU.list.IN ../temp_files/.
    cp ushcn2.tbl ../temp_files/ushcn.tbl

unify_us_ids is all new, and changes 9641C_200907_F52.avg by replacing
the new station IDs with old station IDs (columns 1 and 3 in
ushcnV2_cmb.tbl):
    #! /bin/ksh
    while read a b c d
    do sed "s/^$a/$c/g" < $1 > $1.1
       mv -f $1.1 $1
    done < ushcnV2_cmb.tbl
    sort -n $1 > $1.1
    mv -f $1.1 $1

USHCNv2_to_v2.f is based on USHCN_to_v2.f, with some changes for the
new data format.

reduce_strange is all new, and removes some lines from
Ts.strange.RSU.list.IN_full to make Ts.strange.RSU.list.IN.
Specifically, ones which have country code 425 and which don't have
any matching lines in USHCN.v2.mean_noFIL (the output from USHCNv2_to_v2):
    #! /bin/ksh

    while read a b
    do if [[ $a != '425'* ]]
       then echo "$a $b"
       else c=$( grep $a ../USHCN.v2.mean_noFIL | head -1 ) 2> /dev/null
          if [[ $c != '' ]]
          then echo "$a $b"
          fi
       fi
    done < Ts.strange.RSU.list.IN_full > Ts.strange.RSU.list.IN

USHCN2v2.f has become USHCN_to_v2.f, and is identical apart from
correcting a trivial bug (which we have already fixed in step0.py).

dif.ushcn.ghcn.f identical

cmb2.ushcn.v2.f has changed to support the skip_US behaviour.
    It now takes the $skip_US argument.
    Internally, that becomes only_USHCN.
    In a normal run only_USHCN will be false,
    but if do_comb_step0.sh is given a non-zero second argument
    then only_USHCN will be true.

    When reading a line from GHCN, if icc is 425 and
    the id is in [710000000, 900000000), cont_US is set to true,
    otherwise false.

    If we're about to write a GHCN line, and if (cont_US and
    only_USHCN), skip the line.

    So if $skip_US is zero, the semantics are identical.  If $skip_US
    is 1, it omits any GHCN lines from this range of station
    IDs (which, based on the variable name, is the continental US) -
    but still copies the USHCN lines.

hohp_to_v2.f identical 

cmb.hohenp.v2.f identical
