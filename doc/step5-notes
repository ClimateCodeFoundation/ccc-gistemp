                            Notes on STEP5

1. Introduction

These are notes on STEP5 of GISTEMP, made as part of the CCC-GISTEMP
project.

2. I/O in the original GISTEMP STEP5

do_comb_step5.sh [<R>, default 100], which farms some script work out
to zonav ho2.GHCN.CL.PA, drives this.  It moves files around and
renames them to take advantage of Fortran's implicit filenames and to
allow each Fortran program to be oblivious to the names of actual data
files.  Disregarding that, STEP5 consists of 3 Fortran programs do,
which act as follows:

input_files/SBBX1880.Ts.GHCN.CL.PA.1200 [10]
input_files/SBBX.HadR2 [11]

-> SBBXotoBX.f <R> 0
   "C *** This program combines 8000 subbox to 80 box data"
   ->

[12] BX.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.1200 [11]

(SBBXotoBX.f also simultaneously combines the ocean data from the
SBBX.HadR2 file)

-> zonav.f
   "C**** This program combines the given gridded data (anomalies)
    C**** to produce AVERAGES over various LATITUDE BELTS."
    ->

[stdout] zonav.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.log
[10] work_files/ZON.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.1200.step1

-> annzon.f
   "C *** program reads ZONAL monthly means and recomputes REGIONAL means
    C *** as well as annual means."
   ->

[stdout] annzon.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.log
[96] results/ZonAnn.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.txt
[97] results/GLB.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.txt
[98] results/NH.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.txt
[99] results/SH.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.txt
[12] work_files/ZON.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.1200
[11] work_files/ANNZON.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.1200
[10] deleted

2. After reorganising

We threw away all the driver shell scripts (which were written in ksh)
and wrote run.sh.  At the same time we reorganised all files into
directories (work/ input/ result/ and log/), stopped deleting and
renaming intermediate files, and made minor edits to the Fortran to
accommodate this.  Following this (looking at the code at SVN revision
level 66), step 5 does this (in run.sh):

  GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT="big_endian:10,11,12" bin/SBBXotoBX.exe 100 0 > log/SBBXotoBX.log
  GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT="big_endian:10,11" bin/zonav.exe > log/zonav.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.log
  GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT="big_endian:10,11,12" bin/annzon.exe  > log/annzon.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.log

The GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT directives make sure that each program uses
big-endian format when reading and writing binary data.
When viewed one program at a time, this is what they do:

2.1. SBBXotoBX.f

Reads:
  unit 10: work/SBBX1880.Ts.GHCN.CL.PA.1200
           big-endian binary data giving the monthly mean temperature
           anomaly, derived from land surface stations, for each of 8000
           "sub-boxes".  Produced by STEP3.
  unit 11: input/SBBX.HadR2
           big-endian binary data giving the monthly mean temperature
           anomaly, derived from sea-surface observations, for each of 8000
           "sub-boxes".  Produced by STEP4 (or available from GISS).
Writes:
  unit 12: result/BX.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.1200
           big-endian binary data giving the monthly mean temperature
           anomaly, and area weight, for each of 80 "boxes".
  unit 6:  (stdout) log/SBBXotoBX.log
           text log showing the results, monthly mean temperature
           anomalies and area weight

2.2. zonav.f

Reads:
  unit 11: result/BX.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.1200
           Just written by SBBXotoBX.f; See above.

Writes:
  unit 10: work/ZON.Ts.ho2.GHCN.CL.PA.1200.step1
           big-endian binary data giving monthly mean temperature
           anomaly, and area weight, for each of 14 zones (8
           latitudinal belts, 3 broader belts, the northern and
           southern hemispheres, and the whole globe).  The narrow
           zones correspond to the box borders.  The full set of zones
           is:
              1 64N - 90N
              2 44N - 64N (asin 0.9)
              3 24N - 44N (asin 0.7)
              4 Equ - 24N (asin 0.4)
              5 24S - Equ
              6 44S - 24S
              7 64S - 44S
              8 90S - 64S
              9 24N - 90N
             10 24S - 24N

3. SBBXotoBX.f details

This reads land data (work/SBBX1880.Ts.GHCN.CL.PA.1200) and ocean data
(input/SBBX.HadR2), which are in very similar forms, and combines
them.

For each box:
  for each sub-box:
    read the land data to first half of AVG array
    read the ocean data to second half of AVG array
    put the counts of valid land and ocean data values into WGTC array
    calculate an ocean weight WOCN
    use this to re-weight the WGTC counts
  sort the WGTC array, i.e. sort the land and ocean data records in order
  of decreasing weight.
  Initialize weighted average from highest-weighted record.
  For all the other records with weight >= 12 * NOVRLP, in order of decreasing weight:
    Combine (CMBINE) the record into the weighted average
  Using the combined data:
    Calculate the "bias" (average over the base period) for each month
    of the year using TAVG (see below), and subtract it from every
    data value.
  Write the de-biased combined data to the output file and the log.

The subroutines CMBINE, TAVG, and SORT are identical to STEP3
to.SBBXgrid.f, except in two respects:

- CMBINE in SBBXotoBX.f logs an " UNUSED DATA" line to stdout if any
  months have not combined.  This does not happen.

- SORT uses an array of REAL weights, not INTEGER ones.

For CMBINE, see the comment and docstring for the corresponding Python
function in STEP3.

The subroutine GRIDEA is effectively the same as that in the STEP3
files and zonav: certainly it produces the same set of boxes and
sub-boxes.  The results are only used for the coordinates of the boxes
(not the sub-boxes), and for setting the AREA() array to 1.

Note: The ocean weight (wocn) is calculated in three separate places,
with a subtle difference which may be a bug.  In the first place
(lines 173-176) it is calculated for each sub-box.  In the second
and third places (191-194, 210-213) it is calculated for a data
record (either land or ocean).  For an ocean record, when the number
of valid data items is less than 12 * NOVRLP, (i.e. 240), and dist
>= Rland (i.e. 100), the first calculation will produce wocn = 0
but the latter two calculations will produce wocn > 0 (wocn = 1
when Rintrp == 0, which it does).

In fact, it is slightly worse than we (originally) thought.  In the
second and third places where the ocean weight is calculated, the WGTC
array is abused.  Line 193 (and the identical line 212) accesses
WGTC(nc+ncm) when nc indexes a land cell.  The intention seems to be to
consider the record length of the ocean cell corresponding to this land
cell.  However, WGTC has been sorted ("CALL SORT", line 187), so
WGTC(nc+ncm) does not access the WGTC element for the corresponding
ocean cell, but merely *a* cell (land or ocean) in the region (one
that appears in the "bottom 100 cells by record length").

The overall effect of this is to (more or less) randomly "promote" some
land cells where DIST > Rland and give them positive weight, even when
there is ocean data for that location.  It may be the case that for some
particular cell both land and ocean data end up being combined.

Note: the AREA array (filled in by GRIDEA, then later multiplied
cell-wise by the area of one subbox) is accessed a few times.  The
access on line 198 (just before the FORTRAN label 205) looks suspect.
The array is indexed using the variable NC; sadly this variable can
be in the range 1 to 200, whereas the array index should range from
1 to 100.  Because of the way FORTRAN arrays are laid out in memory,
and the fact that the array element values are constant, this is
harmless for all but the highest numbered box (when NR is 80).  For
this box, if NC > 100 (in other words, an ocean value) we will read
off the end of the array.  Which seems bad to me [drj].  This only
affects the first subbox considered for the box.  They are sorted
essentially by record length, so this bug only comes up if the
longest subbox record in region 80 is an ocean cell.  Box 80, by
the way, is bounded by -64.2 on the north, -90 on the south, +90
on the west, and +180 on the east.  Eyeballing the HadSST2 grid and
the GISTEMP grid, it looks like that box has very little ocean data,
and lots of (presumably interpolated) land data.

Note: setting wocn to zero when fewer than 12 * NOVRLP ocean values is
premature optimization because these ocean records won't be combined
anyway because we only combine records with weight over 12 * NOVRLP.

Note: TAVG calculates the "bias", i.e. time average over the base
period 1961-1990, for each month of the year, for a record.  But if
there is a month of the year for which there is no valid data in the
base period, it calculates a bias over every year in the record.
Given that we have a hypothesis that there is a trend in the data, and
the base period may not be central to this trend, this is surely
bogus.  It doesn't appear to actually happen in SBBXotoBX.f, because
the boxes are so large that each box has at least some valid data in
at least one year of the base period for each month of the year.
However, it surely happens in STEP3 (where the identical code is
applied to sub-boxes) ?

4. zonav.f details

STEP4_5/zonav.f is identical to STEP3/zonav.f

[the zonav notes are somewhat under construction, ask drj if you need to]

The Fortran code variously refers to belt and bands and zones.  Here I
try to use "belt" for the 8 basic latitude belts (4 in each hemisphere,
the same belts used to form the equal area 80 boxes).  And "zone" for
the combined zones that are made from combinations of belts:

There are 6 large zones are defined as various combinations of the
8 belts.  The KZONE array maintains the characteristic function:
KZONE(b,c) is 1 when belt b is part of combined zone c.  b ranges
from 1 to 8, c from 1 to 6.  Let xxxx-yyyy be the 8 basic zones (from
North on the left to South on the right).  The combined zones are as
follows:

1110-0000 northern (N-T)
0001-1000 tropical T
0000-0111 southern (S-T)
1111-0000 northern hemisphere N
0000-1111 southern hemisphere S
1111-1111 global N+S

We can define T, N, and S as "primitives" and then compose the other
combined zones using set operations. (I don't know whether this is
useful, but it's cute).

Useful to note:

JBM=8 (number of belts)
NZS=3 (number of "special" zones.  which is 3 less than the number of
  zones. *sigh*)

In detail:

line 97 to 106: gather metadata from input file.

line 129 to 177: for each belt:
  Combine the records the the regions in that belt (by reading them from
  the BX file into AR and WTR), sorting them to combine longer regions
  first.
  line 160 to 176: the record for the belt is biased to make it zero on
    average for the reference period, and it is written to the output
    file (unit 10)

line 181: The 8 belts are then sorted by record length. (so that when
they are combined into zones, below, the longest record is used first)

line 182 to 217: for each zone (6 of them)
  combine the belts that comprise that zone into a single record, rebias
  it and write it out to disk.  Details follow:
  line 188 to 190: find the longest belt that is in the zone.
  line 191 to 194: and initialise WTG and AVGG with that belt's record
  line 196 to 201: and the loop over the rest of the belts, calling
  CMBINE to add in the belts that are included in the zone.
  line 203 and following: rebias and write to disk.

5. annzon.f

[not written yet, see drj]

JZM=14 (the number of zones)
MONMIN=6 (the minimum number of months to compute an annual anomaly)
IAVGGH=2 (alternate global and hemispheric means)

JZG records which zones comprise the alternate global mean computation
(alternate 2 is in fact used by default, see IAVGGH).  They are:
Alternate 1: 9,10,10,11; Alternate 2: 9,4,5,11 (see array literal at
annzon.f line 50).  These 4 zones are combined with weights 3,2,2,3
respectively (see WTSP array, line 51).  These weights are proportional
to the area of the zone (for these particlar zones).

line 53 to 83: open file, read header, allocate arrays.
line 84 to 97: write header.
line 98 to 103: read data.
line 104 to 122: Compute annual means.

Note: the output files say "base period 1951-1980".  But the
de-biasing we've just been looking at in SBBXotoBX.f uses a base
period of IYBASE-LYBASE, i.e. 1961-1990 (these are parameters in
SBBXotoBX.f).  Of course, this data has already been de-biased in
STEP3, with a base period of 1951-1980.  Is this all sensible and
legitimate?  They are (yet again) rebiased to have a base period of
1951-1980 by zonav.f (which is run immediately before zonav.f)
