For STEP0 see step0-update-notes

STEP1:

Ts.strange.RSU.list.IN and ushcn.tbl both come from STEP0 now.

There is a typo correction in v2.inv:  40371964000 is called WHITEHORSE, Y, not WITHEHORSE, Y.

The driver script has changed to use more consistent directories for
input, output, and temporary files.

STEP2:

A typo correction in v2.inv, matching the one in STEP1:  40371964000 is called WHITEHORSE, Y, not WITHEHORSE, Y.

Directory renames for intermediate files.

text_to_binary.f has a check for Antartica:

      if(sid(1:2)=='90') then
        name(31:36)=' RC700' ! Antarctica
      else
        // existing code
      end if

STEP3:

Directory renames for intermediate files.

to.SBBXgrid.f:
  236c236
  <          DO 110 N=1,NCM
  ---
  >          DO 110 NC=1,NCM

STEP4_5:

Fixed the ocean-weighting bug we found in SBBXotoBX.f
