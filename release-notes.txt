1. INTRODUCTION

These are the release notes for release x.x.x of the Clear Climate
Code GISTEMP project (CCC-GISTEMP).

Clear Climate Code is reimplementing GISTEMP (the GISS surface
temperature analysis system) in Python, to make it clearer.

For instructions on installing and running the CCC GISTEMP, see the
product readme (readme.txt).

For up-to-date information about releases of CCC GISTEMP see the
project home page <http://www.clearclimatecode.org/>.  From there you
will find links to the latest releases, including reports of defects
found.


2. SUPPORTED CONFIGURATIONS

No support for CCC GISTEMP is provided.


3. GETTING HELP

If you have problems with CCC, please feel free to contact
support@clearclimatecode.org.


4. WHAT'S FIXED

This section lists defects that have been fixed.

4.1. WHAT'S FIXED SINCE RELEASE 0.1.0

Since moving CCC-GISTEMP from Ravenbrook's own internal servers to
GoogleCode, we haven't yet written the necessary scripts to generate
lists of fixed defects from GoogleCode, so this section is incomplete.


4.2. WHAT WAS FIXED IN RELEASE 0.1.0

ESSENTIAL

job001914: GISTEMP relies on ksh

All the driver scripts in GISTEMP are written in ksh.  Nothing ships
with ksh, and it's moderately hard to install a working version of it on
(for instance) FreeBSD.  This reduces the utility of CCC GISTEMP to the
public: they need to go and get an obscure tool, and install it.


job001916: No single driver script in GISTEMP.

The GISTEMP downloadable sources (in CCC version 0.0) do not come with a
single script to drive the whole process.  There are several driver
scripts (e.g. STEP0/do_comb_step0.sh) and a top-level gistemp.txt
description of the process, supplemented by instructive messages
produced by each driver script as it runs.  This is not very accessible
to interested members of the public.


job001917: STEP0 is in FORTRAN

STEP 0 of the GISTEMP code is in FORTRAN.  This makes it unclear to the
public.


job001919: STEP3 is in FORTRAN

STEP 3 of the GISTEMP code is in FORTRAN.  This makes it unclear to the
public.


job001922: STEP 1 is in FORTRAN

STEP 1 of the GISTEMP code is in FORTRAN.  This makes it unclear to the
public.


OPTIONAL

job001915: GISTEMP has no graphical output

The GISTEMP sources as distributed by GISS don't have any graphical
outputs.  Some basic graphical output would be very useful for
sanity-checking during development.


job001923: GISTEMP data files don't have consistent locations

GISTEMP reads source data files from directories mostly called
STEP*/input_files/, writes intermediate files in */work_files/, writes
some log files into */log/, output files in */out/, archived files in
*/old/, and so on.  Configuration files also live in /input_files/.
Files have to be moved manually between steps in between running the
separate step driver scripts.  Executables live adjacent to the source
code. It's all a bit of a mess.


4.3. WHAT WAS FIXED IN RELEASE 0.0.3


ESSENTIAL

job001910: STEP2 infinite loop on some platforms

The PApars.f part of GISTEMP STEP2 runs forever, when compiled with GNU
Fortran 4.2.5 20080702 on FreeBSD 6.3.


OPTIONAL

job001911: PApars algorithm unclear

GISTEMP STEP2/PApars.f has quite a lot of old FORTRAN code which is
obscure.  The large header comment is also incorrect in places.


4.4. WHAT WAS FIXED IN RELEASE 0.0.2


ESSENTIAL

job001909: GISTEMP STEP0 discards the final digit of every USHCN datum

The GISTEMP STEP0 code which reads the USHCN temperature records and
converts them to the GISTEMP v2.mean format fails to read the full width
of each datum.  Each datum occupies 6 columns in the data file (-99.99
to 999.99), but only the first five columns are read and converted to a
float.  This was detected by the Clear Climate Code project in
diagnosing a difference between the output of the FORTRAN STEP0 and
Python step0.py.


4.5. WHAT WAS FIXED IN RELEASE 0.0.1


ESSENTIAL

job001907: Python EXTENSIONS directory is compressed

GISTEMP includes STEP1/EXTENSIONS.tar.gz.  To run GISTEMP, following the
instructions in PYTHON_README.txt, one needs an uncompressed directory.


job001908: CCC readme and release notes are patchy

CCC version 0.0 is GISTEMP as released by GISS; release 0.0.0 was
GISTEMP as released on 2007-10-10.  The packaging materials (readme and
release notes) for 0.0.0 were cloned poorly from the P4DTI project and
need generally sprucing up before 0.0.1 or 0.1.0.


OPTIONAL

job001906: Python scripts use bad path in shebang

The Python scripts in GISTEMP STEP1 use /gcm/jglascoe/bin/python as the
path to Python in the "shebang" #! first line of the file.  This is not
very portable to say the least.


4.6. WHAT WAS FIXED IN RELEASE 0.0.0


Nothing.  Release 0.0.0 is just GISTEMP as released on 2007-10-10,
plus readme.txt and release-notes.txt.
