"""This module extends sys.path to include this module's parent directory.

This module is imported for its deliberate side effect of extending
``sys.path`` to include the parent directory of this module. The idea
is that any script in the ``tool`` directory can import code in the
``code`` package, for example, as follows::

    import extend_path
    from code import script_support
