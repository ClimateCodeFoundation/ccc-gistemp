"""
stationmask.py cells [stations]

Extract a list of stations that are in a selected set of cells.  The subbox
cells are taken from the *cells* file which should be in the same
format as step5mask (value 0.000 excludes that cell, any other value
includes it).  For rectangular regions, you can produce a suitable mask
file with tool/rectmask.py.

The locations of the stations are taken from the input/v2.inv file.  The
list of stations is taken from the *stations* file, using input/v2.inv
when this is not specified.
