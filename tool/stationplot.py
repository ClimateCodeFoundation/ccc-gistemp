Usage: python stationplot.py [-d v2.mean] [-o file.svg] station-id

Tool to plot the records for a station.  Stations have an 11-digit
identifier, and in the GHCN file v2.mean they have a single digit added, the
duplicate marker, to form a 12-digit record identifier.  One station may
have several "duplicate" records associated with it.

Specifying an 11-digit identifier will plot all the duplicates
associated with that station; a 12-digit indentifier will plot only a
single record.

Normally the output is an SVG document written to the file plot.svg.
The -o option can be used to change where it written ("-o -" specifies stdout).

Normally the input is the GHCN dataset input/v2.mean; the -d option
specifies an alternate input file ("-d -" specifies stdin).
