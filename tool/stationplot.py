Usage: python stationplot.py [options] station-id

The options are:
  [-a] [-d v2.mean] [-o file.svg] [-t YYYY,YYYY]

Tool to plot the records for a station.  Stations have an 11-digit
identifier, and in the GHCN file v2.mean they have a single digit added, the
duplicate marker, to form a 12-digit record identifier.  One station may
have several "duplicate" records associated with it.

Specifying an 11-digit identifier will plot all the duplicates
associated with that station; a 12-digit indentifier will plot only a
single record.

Anomalies can be plotted (each datum has the mean for that month
subtracted from it) by using the -a option.

The -t option will restrict the time axis so that only records between
the beginning of the first year and the beginning of the second year are
displayed (in other words, the second year is excluded from the
displayed range).

Normally the output is an SVG document written to the file
station-id.svg (in other words, the first argument with ".svg" appended).
The -o option can be used to change where it written ("-o -" specifies stdout).

Normally the input is the GHCN dataset input/v2.mean; the -d option
specifies an alternate input file ("-d -" specifies stdin).
