#
# Converts the gridded subbox file output from STEP3, often called
# SBBX1880.Ts.GHCN.CL.PA.1200, to a text format so that they can be
# compared.
#
# David Jones.  Ravenbrook Limited.
#
# The comments at the top of to.SBBXgrid.f that describe the output
# file formats are incorrect.  The actual format of this file is a
# Fortran binary file with an initial header record followed by a series
# of identically formatted records, one for each subbox:
#
# Record 1: Header
# Record 2: AVG array, lats, latn, lonw, lone, nstns, nstmns, d
# Record 3: ...
#
# The header comprises of 8 words followed by 80 characters:
# INFO(1)   1 (when not trimmed); NM1 (when trimmed)
#     (2)   KQ
#     (3)   MAVG
#     (4)   MONM (length of each time series)
#     (5)   reclen (length of each record in words)
#     (6)   IYRBEG (first year of time series)
#     (7)   BAD (bad data value, as integer)
#     (8)   precipitation trace flag
# TITLE     80-character string.

# (input) Files can be trimmed or untrimmed (see trimSBBX.f).
#
# For a trimmed file the first word of each record determines the number
# of months of station data for the next record.  Python does not need
# this and generally ignores it.  But, it uses this value in the first
# record (which is the header, above) to determine in the file is
# trimmed or not.
#
# The order of data for the remaining records of the file (all the
# records subsequent to the first header record) depends on whether the
# file is trimmed or not.
#
# Each record (except the first) consists of the data series for a
# single subbox.  Comprising:
# - for untrimmed:
#      - single-precision floats;
#      - record metadata.
# - for trimmed:
#      - NMi (the number of data in the _next_ record);
#      - record metadata;
#      - single-precision floats.
#
# The single-precision floats are the record data.  For untrimmed files
# their are MONM floats (see header for MONM); for trimmed files the
# number of floats is given by the first word in the previous record
# (denoted NMi above).  For either trimmed or untrimmed the metadata is
# the same (but where it appears in the record differs):
#
# 4 (signed) integers for the bounds of the subbox (in centidegrees,
#   with the usual Earth co-ordinate system).
# nstns (unsigned integer) is the number of stations combined into
#   the subbox time series
# nstmn (unsigned integer) is the total number of data used from all
#   the combined stations
# d (single precision float) is an approximation to the distance from the
#   box centre to the nearest station used.
